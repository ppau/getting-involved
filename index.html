    <h2>Elections</h2>

      <!-- I want to volunteer on election day? -->

      <h3>I want to volunteer on election day</h3>

        <h4>You Rock!</h4>

        <p>The most important thing supporters can do on election day is get to a polling place and hand out our "How to Vote" flyers.</p>
        <p>Looking at our results from past elections we can often get up to (and even over) <b>double</b> our usual vote at polling places that we have had a volunteer working at. It really helps to get our message across, and let people know who we are
          and what we stand for. And this results in more votes!</p>
        <p>If you are able to help, please email us at <a href="mailto:nationalcouncil@pirateparty.org.au?subject=Election%20Day%20Volunteer">nationalcouncil@pirateparty.org.au</a>.</p>


      <!--You aren't running in my state, but I still want to help-->

      <h3>You aren't running in my state, but I still want to help</h3>

        <h4>Awesome, you can still help!</h4>

        <p>Unfortunately we can't always run in every state due to either lack of money, or no volunteers to be candidates. If you want to see us run in your state next time perhaps you may want to stand as a candidate?</p>
        <p>Even so, you can always <a href="https://pirateparty.org.au/donate/" target="_blank">donate</a> to help, but also on election day just tweet, post on facebook, generate word of mouth etc. </p>
        <p>Perhaps take a look at some of the other options on this page to help, many of those teams and areas will need extra assistance on election day.</p>


      <!--I want to be a candidate/run in an election-->

      <h3>I want to be a candidate/run in an election</h3>

        <h4>Stepping up! Great.</h4>

        <p>This is a pretty big deal, and to be selected as a candidate you will need to undergo a preselection process and be 'elected' by your fellow party members as a candidate first.</p>
        <p>Our preselection by-laws are <a href="https://pirateparty.org.au/wiki/By-laws#By-law_2013-02_-_Preselection" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
        <p>There will be a few hoops to jump through for this one, and it'll require some commitment from you. For more information email the National Council: <a href="mailto:nationalcouncil@pirateparty.org.au?subject=Election%20Candidacy">nationalcouncil@pirateparty.org.au</a>.</p>

    <h2>Press</h2>

      <!--What is a press release?-->

      <h3>What is a press release?</h3>

        <h4>Glad you asked!</h4>

        <p>A press release is a short statement by the Pirate Party (usually under 500 words) on a current issue that is provided to the media. Press releases usually respond to an event and promote the Pirate Party's position on that event (agreement or
          disagreement, and why).</p>
        <p>When appropriate, press releases are used to announce candidates or new policies, and promote existing policies and campaigns.</p>
        <p>Press releases are written in a similar style to news articles, but focus on the Pirate Party's position rather than reporting objective facts. Past press releases are available <a href='https://pirateparty.org.au/category/press-release/'>here</a>.</p>

    <h2>Leadership</h2>

      <!--I want to join the National Council-->

      <h3>I want to join the National Council</h3>

        <h4>Whoa, watch out Napoleon!</h4>

        <p>The National Council is the primary and paramount administrative body of the Pirate Party.</p>
        <p>Nine Councillors (the President, Secretary and Treasurer, their deputies, a Registered Officer and two Councillors) are elected at the National Congress for terms of approximately one year. Nominations must be submitted in advance of the National
          Congress, which occurs every July. Members are notified at least 42 days in advance of the National Congress and informed of how to nominate themselves.</p>
        <p>Only Full Members and Permanent Resident Members are able to be elected to the National Council.</p>

      <!--I want to be an Officer-->

      <h3>I want to be an Officer</h3>

        <h4>Get into your fatigues, Mayo.</h4>

        <p>Officers lead committees and teams or fulfil other specialist roles within the Pirate Party.</p>
        <p>With the exception of the Policy Development Officer, all officers are appointed by the National Council for an indefinite period. The National Council does not ordinarily take applications for Officer positions unless it has formally announced
          a vacancy and invites applications.
        </p>
        <p>The National Council usually invites a member to take up an Officer position where they display an appropriate aptitude and enthusiasm and there is a relevant position being created or vacated. Thus, active participation and involvement within
          the Party is likely to lead to an appointment.
        </p>
        <p>The Policy Development Officer leads the Policy Development Committee and is elected annually at the National Congress. Nominations must be submitted in advance of the National Congress, which occurs every July. Members are notified at least 42
          days in advance of the National Congress and informed of how to nominate themselves. Information on this position and committee is available <a href='https://pirateparty.org.au/wiki/Policy_Development_Committee/Terms_of_Reference'>here</a>.</p>

        <h4>Great, we need more troops on the ground!</h4>

          to hold a meeting, however.</p>
        <p>The National Council does not ordinarily take applications for Coordinator positions unless it has formally announced a vacancy and invites applications.</p>
        <p>The National Council usually invites a member to take up a Coordinator position where they display an appropriate aptitude and enthusiasm and there is a relevant vacancy. Thus, active participation and involvement within the Party is likely to
