      <div title="I want to volunteer on election day" class="subcategory">

        <h2>You Rock!</h2>

        <p>The most important thing supporters can do on election day is get to a polling place and hand out our "How to Vote" flyers.</p>

        <p>Looking at our results from past elections we can often get up to (and even over) <b>double</b> our usual vote at polling places that we have had a volunteer working at. It really helps to get our message across, and let people know who we are
          and what we stand for. And this results in more votes!</p>

        <p>If you are able to help, please email us at <a href="mailto:nationalcouncil@pirateparty.org.au">nationalcouncil@pirateparty.org.au</a>.</p>

        <h2>Awesome, you can still help!</h2>

        <p>Unfortunately we can't always run in every state due to either money, or no volunteers to be candidates. If you want to see us run in your state next time perhaps you may want to stand as a candidate?</p>

        <p>Even so, you can always <a href="https://pirateparty.org.au/donate/" target="_blank">donate</a> to help, but also on election day just tweet, post on facebook, generate word of mouth etc. </p>

        <p>Perhaps take a look at some of the other options on this page to help, many of those teams and areas will need extra assistance on election day.</p>

      <div title="I want to be a candidate/run in an election" class="subcategory">

        <h2>Stepping up! Great.</h2>

        <p>This is a pretty big deal, and to be selected as a candidate you will need to undergo a preselection process and be 'elected' by your fellow party members as a candidate first.</p>

        <p>Our preselection by-laws are <a href="https://pirateparty.org.au/wiki/By-laws#By-law_2013-02_-_Preselection" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

        <p>There will be a few hoops to jump through for this one, and it'll require some commitment from you. For more information email the National Council: <a href="mailto:nationalcouncil@pirateparty.org.au">nationalcouncil@pirateparty.org.au</a>.</p>

      <!--What is a press release?-->

      <div title="What is a press release?" class="subcategory">

        <h2>Glad you asked!</h2>

        <p>A press release is a short statement by the Pirate Party (usually under 500 words) on a current issue that is provided to the media. Press releases usually respond to an event and promote the Pirate Party's position on that event (agreement or
          disagreement, and why).</p>

        <p>When appropriate, press releases are used to announce candidates or new policies, and promote existing policies and campaigns.</p>

        <p>Press releases are written in a similar style to news articles, but focus on the Pirate Party's position rather than reporting objective facts. Past press releases are available <a href='https://pirateparty.org.au/category/press-release/'>here</a>.</p>
